# osrs-woodcut
A simple woodcutting bot for early players, specifically for use in the woods right behind lumbridge castle. 
Utilizing NodeJS and RobotJS.
everything I say to paste into a terminal, remove the quotes from it before you do so.

NodeJS Setup:
1.) download, https://nodejs.org/en/download.
When installing, make sure you select the box "install neccessary tools" or you will get errors when running the bot.
2.) Open your command prompt or powershell and paste "npm --version".
If installed with no errors you should be returned with something like "8.15.0".

Project setup:
I use VS code for my projects. can work with notepad but I dont remember how to setup for that. 
1.) Open file in vs studio.
2.) Open console and type "node index.js" to change directory of file .
3.) Enter "npm init -y" in console to setup nodeJS package. (lets us install robotJS and creates package.json file)
4.) Finally, enter "npm install robotjs" into the console. If you run into an error at this step while installing you forgot to check the box from NodeJS Setup step 1.

Bot setup:
1.) Once everything above is done, head behind lumbridge to the woods. Stay near the walls of the castle and enter the woods enough so the back walls are at the edge of the screen.
2.) Equip your axe, empty your inventory, open your project, and type "npm start" in the console. Open runescape quickly after you do this. 
3.) Enjoy your free levels.
4.) Once you are ready, tab back into visual studio and ctrl + c to end the program. If this is not working for some reason then you can close VS studio.

P.S: The bot will get lost sometimes... so you will have to check on it every now and then. Enjoy!
